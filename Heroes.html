                    <p>Opening this rating is a cult character not only of cinema, but also of the book worlds of writer John R. R. Tolkien – Aragorn. In the cinema, the role of the first king of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor was brilliantly played by Viggo Mortensen. His character appeared in the films: "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King".</p>

                    <p>Pirate, captain, eccentric, charming and never despairing – of course, this is Jack Sparrow. Apologies, Captain Jack Sparrow. Screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio created Captain Jack in the spirit of characters from classic literature and opera, such as Figaro; comic, mischievous counterpoint to the film's heroes. In all five films of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series, his role was played by Johnny Depp.</p>

In addition to solo films, Iron Man also appeared in a series of superhero films: "The Avengers", "Spider-Man" and "The Incredible Hulk".</p>

                    <p>One could endlessly praise Michael J. Fox for his role in the film "Back to the Future", but the fact remains – his character Marty McFly is still considered one of the most cult characters in the history of cinema. The "Back to the Future" trilogy is still very captivating and interesting to watch even thirty-eight years after the release of the first film.</p>

This character of the series of action films "Die Hard" was played by Bruce Willis in all five films. An excellent character, an excellent role that undoubtedly brought Bruce Willis's career to a new level. It's a shame that we probably won't see him in this role anymore.</p>

                    <p>One of the characters of "Marvel" has already flown into this rating, let's give a chance to "DC". Well, Batman deserved this chance fully. A successful industrialist, philanthropist, lover of bats and cool high-tech equipment, who devoted his life to fighting for justice – and all this is one character. The role of Bruce Wayne was played by many actors, but as much as we twist, Batman was, is and will be one of the most cult movie heroes.</p>
